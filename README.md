# Brain games
This repository contains simple command-line games written in Python as part of the "DevOps Engineer from Scratch" educational project. Each game greets the user and asks a question such as whether a number is even.

## Games

- **brain-games**: Greets the user and asks for their name.
- **brain-even**: Asks the user whether a randomly generated number is even.
- **brain-clac**: Asks the user to calculate the expression and write the right answer
- **brain-gcd**: Asks the user to find GCD (greatest common divisor)
- **brain-progression**: Asks the user to find ommited number in the sequence of numbers 

More games may be added as the project evolves.
